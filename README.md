# google-homepage
HTML/CSS project to recreate the Google homepage

Utilized HTML and CSS to recreate the google homepage.
Learning outcomes:
Create a navigation bar at the top of the page using
a list of links. Centered the Google logo in the middle
of the page and placed a search bar underneath. Two
buttons for Google Search and I'm feeling luck were
alligned under the search bar with hover effects. A
footer was placed at the bottom of the page similar to
the way the naviagtion bar was made using a list of links.

This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum.
